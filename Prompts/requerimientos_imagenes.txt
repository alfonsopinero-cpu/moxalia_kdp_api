NATURE (STRICT — LOCATION ACCURACY)

Vegetation, landscape elements and animals MUST be geographically and climatically correct for the specific city or region depicted.

GENERAL RULE
- Use ONLY flora and fauna that are typical, common and naturally occurring in the real location.
- The scene must reflect the natural environment that a local resident would expect to see.

URBAN VEGETATION
- If the scene is in a city, use ONLY trees and plants commonly found in that city or its region.
- Prefer typical urban trees (e.g. plane trees, oaks, pines, cypresses, maples, lindens, chestnuts, olive trees where appropriate).
- Avoid decorative, tropical or exotic plants unless they are genuinely native and common in that location.

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN VEGETATION
- NO palm trees in non-tropical cities.
- NO tropical plants outside tropical climates.
- NO desert vegetation outside arid regions.
- NO generic “Mediterranean clichés” unless they are botanically accurate for the specific place.

- NO exotic animals.
- NO animals that do not naturally exist in that climate or geography.
- If unsure, OMIT animals entirely.
