TASK
Write a  calm, poetic text meant to be read just before coloring.
The text should place the reader in a quiet, reflective state, without describing the image or explaining the place.

LANGUAGE
- Use the book language.

LENGTH (MANDATORY)
- 2 or 3 short paragraphs (50 to 100 words)

STYLE
- Simple, contained, reflective prose.
- Focus on ideas like time, memory, permanence, presence, human passage, future or others 
- Write as if it were a quiet thought, not a description.

CONTENT RULES
- You may mention the place or monument name once, or not at all.
- Do NOT describe visual elements, architecture, or scenery.
- Do NOT include historical facts or explanations.
- Do NOT tell the reader how to feel.

TONE
- Subtle, calm, and grounded.

- Fewer words, more weight.

AVOID
- Describing what is seen in the illustration.
- Explaining meaning.
- Educational or narrative tone.
- Repeated formulas or openings.

GOAL
The text should feel like a pause.
Something that prepares the mind to begin coloring, not something to analyze.
