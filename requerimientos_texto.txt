EXAMPLE (STYLE ONLY – DO NOT COPY)
A quiet walk along the river slows your thoughts.
Water moves forward without asking where it ends.
Above you, shapes rise and fade into the sky.
Some paths are meant to be followed without knowing why.
You keep walking, trusting that the journey itself is enough.
